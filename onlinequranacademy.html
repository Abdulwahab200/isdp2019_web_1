	<p>Children are much better at memorizing new information than adults, 
	which is why we suggest enrolling them in online Quran courses as young as possible,
	 preferably at the age of five years old. The&nbsp;<em>best website</em>&nbsp;to start&nbsp;
	<em>learning Quran</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>TarteeleQuran. </em>The best time to learn&nbsp;
	anything is from a young age, with teachings remaining in a child’s mind just as a
	 carving remains on a stone indefinitely.</p>
